## ABSTRACT
Scientific posters are essential for communicating research findings to a broader audience. Unfortunately, their importance tends to be overlooked, and many researchers struggle to create informative and visually appealing posters. A lack in this skillset often results in hard work going unnoticed, which poses a significant loss to the scientific community.This paper presents a comprehensive guide to creating more captivating scientific posters. It provides practical tools for researchers to improve their overall presentation and design skills, including tips on layout, color schemes, and data visualization. Additionally, we review classic and modern poster designs, offering recommendations on presentation style and facilitation. Using the recommendations outlined in this paper, researchers can acquire tools to morph their posters into a dazzling work of art, capturing their audience's attention and ensuring their research is understood and appreciated. So, when the post(er)-man rings twice, be prepared to make your science sexy!

## INTRODUCTION

Scientific posters serve as a crucial medium for the dissemination of research findings. They offer a platform for researchers to present their work in a visually appealing and concise manner, facilitating the exchange of ideas and fostering scientific discussions. Despite their significance, the art of creating an effective scientific poster is often overlooked in academic training. This paper aims to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive guide to creating engaging and informative scientific posters.

The importance of scientific posters extends beyond mere aesthetics. A well-designed poster can captivate the audience's attention, simplify complex information, and promote the researcher's work effectively. Conversely, a poorly designed poster can obscure the research message and deter potential discussions. Therefore, mastering the art of poster creation is an essential skill for any researcher.

This paper will delve into the key elements of a successful poster, discuss the principles of design, and analyze case studies of effective posters. It will also provide a step-by-step guide to creating a scientific poster, offering practical tips and recommendations along the way. By the end of this paper, researchers will be equipped with the tools to transform their scientific findings into a visually compelling and informative poster.


## Main Body
The general structure of this paper is to be as easiliy understood as possible. To achiev this every chapter is equipped with a table, which summarizes the contents. If the readers wants a fast overview, the tables should be enough to achieve that.
The source code of this paper can be accessed under https://github.com/UnfriendlySpider/How_to_Poster. I am happy to converse with everyone who is interessted in this topic. There are a lot of different ideads and opinions in this area and I am always happy to get additional information.


### Principles of Effective Communication [1]

Since the beginning of communication humans created tales. It seems to be on of the core needs of humans to tell each other storys and we listen to a lot of different ones during our live. With this training we can often instantly recognize if a story is bad, unstructed, or boring to read/listen/watch to. We can use this ability for the creation of content, as everything can be seen as a story. For that I recommend to look at your poster as a story you want to tell your relatives, friends, and colleques. 
Let them listen to your story and get their feedback. If they tell you, that your story is hard to follow or boring don't be discouraged. It takes a lot of time to create something good.

The story we recognize as interessting follow basic principles which can be applied to every communication. In "The Three Laws of Professional Communication" from Doumont [1] four basic laws are proposed for a good communication style.

|                    | Description |
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| Clear Purpose                     | Have a clear purpose in mind while creating content.             |
| Mind the audience                 | Your poster won't matter if your audience does not understand it. <br><br> You are the expert in the field with a lot of background knowledge. The audience rarely has this and you will need to simplify the content to let them understand it at their level in a short amount of time. <br><br> The common aspect of all the possible audience is, that they don't want to waste their time. |
| Reduce the Noice to Content Ratio | If you want to transfer knowledge there can be a lot of different "noices" which can distract the audience. The more distraction is present the harder it is for your audience to follow the points you find important. To avoid that add only information and don't overengineer your creation. |
| Add Effective Redundancys         | Repetition can be a good tool to emphazize certain information. It is important not to overuse this but if you find something extremley import you can repeat information. For example by adding a relevant graph and adding it in the conclusion. |
|||



The beautiful aspect of a posters is, that it is a medium with a lot of possibilities. You can be creative with the design and the presentation style, but even if posters are a flexible medium, there are some basic rules for effective communication. 
If you create a poster, write a paper, or hold a presentation it is always usefull to remember these principles as they are part of every communication type. 


### Concept Creation

|  Structure         | Description |
| ------------------  | ----------- |
| Define purpose         | At first design yourself a clear for the poster. This is something that can be redefined throughout the creation process, but it  is helpfull to to have a redline to orient yourself along the creation process|
| Choose basic layout    | If you don't now where to start use one of these 4 basic layouts.  |
| Create sketch          | The eaysiest way to start is to create a sketch with pen and paper.|

### Basic Structure

|  Structure         | Description |
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| Title              | The title should be concise, compelling, and descriptive. It should capture the essence of the research and draw the audience in. |
| Introduction       | This section should provide a brief overview of the research topic, its relevance, and the objectives of the study. |
| Methods            | Classicly this section should outline the methodology used in the research. It should be concise and easy to understand, allowing the audience to grasp the approach taken. Some modern approaches completely erase this section and reference to the original paper. |
| Results            | This section should present the key findings of the research. Visual aids such as graphs, charts, and tables can be used to display results effectively. |
| Conclusion         | This section should summarize the findings, discuss their implications, and suggest areas for future research. |
| References         | Any sources cited in the poster should be listed here. Ensure to follow the citation style relevant to your field. |
| Acknowledgments    | This section should acknowledge any individuals or institutions that contributed to the research. |
| Contact Information| Providing contact information allows interested viewers to reach out for further discussion or collaboration. |

### Design Principles

|             | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Hierarchy   | Information should be organized in a hierarchical manner, guiding the viewer's eye from the most important elements (like the title and key findings) to the less critical ones. |
| Consistency | Consistency in fonts, colors, and layout can make the poster look professional and easy to read. |
| Simplicity  | Avoid cluttering the poster with too much text or complex visuals. Keep the design simple and the message clear. |
| Contrast    | Use contrast to highlight key information and make the text readable. This could be contrast in color, size, or typeface. |
| Whitespace  | Whitespace, or negative space, is the area of the poster that is left unmarked. It gives the elements on the poster room to breathe and can help guide the viewer's eye. |
| Color       | Use color sparingly and purposefully. Too many colors can be distracting, while a thoughtful color scheme can enhance the poster's effectiveness. |
| Typography  | Choose fonts that are easy to read from a distance. The text size should be large enough to be read from at least a meter away. |

### Text

| Title | Eye catching wtihout beeing false |
